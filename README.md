## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle-AirBNB-Data :

1. How do you start to host on Airbnb?
2. How do you prepare your room?
3. Predict price


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps. 

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://phoowintzay.blogspot.com/2021/01/how-do-you-host-your-home-on-airbnb.html).
