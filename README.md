## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle-AirBNB-Data :

1. How should you start to host on Airbnb?
2. How should you prepare your room?
3. Which type of cancellation policy is mostly used?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
There is 1 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps. 

## Summary of the results of the analysis<a name="summaryanalysis"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://phoowintzay.blogspot.com/2021/01/how-do-you-host-your-home-on-airbnb.html).

## Necessary acknowledgments<a name="acknowledge"></a>

Must give credit to Airbnb for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
